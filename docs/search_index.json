Howdy there: Figure .: Hello Daniel Kent! 0.0.1 Review Bombs Break Online Reviews and Data Science Transparency is the Answer Online reviews play an incredibly important role in the online purchase path, but are subject to manipulation. Alarmingly, through bad actors and organized groups, significant downside risks to the veracity of online reivews and trust in the marektplaces that host these reviews threaten potentially controversial ecommerce goods and services. Data science is a solution that could better aggregate and inform customers, or potentially change the way online shoppers consume online reivews and choose products. 0.0.2 Could one company’s job postings lead to more revenue for a competitor? For hedge funds, competitors, and everybody in between, nuggets of intel in aggregate can represent millions of dollars of forward-looking revenue advantage. Product launches and expansions are typically reserved to closed-door board meetings, but much of this data must be made public for acquiring the most important resource in development and execution - labor. Through the aggregation, data analysis, and development of actionable insights, data science has the potential to provide an opportunity to reduce information asymetries and better plan and counter activities through the analysis of jobs postings.

["OnlineReviewBombsAndDataScience.html", "1 Review Bombs Break Online Reviews and Data Science Transparency is the Answer 1.1 E-Commerce has altered how we shop and think about shopping 1.2 Reviews: Increased Conversion, but Buyer Beware 1.3 Smarter Consumers &amp; Purchases through Data Science", " 1 Review Bombs Break Online Reviews and Data Science Transparency is the Answer 1.0.0.1 Keywords Online Review Bombs, Review Bombs, Online Reviews, eBay, Amazon, Customer Reviews, Data Science, Visualizations, Statistics, Histograms, Data Transparency, Reviews Transparency, Reviews, Customer Review, Valve, Steam, Etsy, Verified Reviews 1.1 E-Commerce has altered how we shop and think about shopping Online retail has displaced a significant amount of brick-and-mortar retail and in doing so, fundamentally changed the way that consumers shop and purchase goods. If the rapid growth of Amazon and Walmart’s online offerings are any indication, retail e-commerce will continue to grow at a breakneck speed. For example, online retail sales are (expected)[ https://www.statista.com/statistics/272391/us-retail-e-commerce-sales-forecast/] to nearly double between the period of 2016 and 2022. As more and more individuals turned online to research and purchase goods, consumer behavior was altered by the inclusion of additional contextual information provided near product offerings that frequently increase products’ purchase rates. One such example, popularized early during the rise of e-commerce, was the inclusion of the voice of the customer in product reviews and testimonials. These reviews are now a standard e-commerce practice and can provide valuable insight into products’ quality for consumers, but manipulation from some actors can occlude the true quality of a product, leading to lost consumer surplus, confidence, increased returns, and dissatisfied customers. 1.2 Reviews: Increased Conversion, but Buyer Beware Many consumers place trust and confidence in online reviews – perhaps rightfully so as the theory of the “Wisdom of the Crowds” suggests. Online reviews provide an additional signal (in addition to price, brand, availability and so forth) about the quality of a good. According to an article by Business Insider, a distinct portion of online shoppers will refuse to purchase products lacking positive reviews from other customers. Further, the article mentions, as we described above, that well-integrated, positive reviews have been demonstrated to increase sales by nearly 20% on some websites. There is likely little doubt that the majority of individuals who write and consume online reviews do so with the best of intentions and were there no bad actors, online reviews would provide meaningful and valuable textual information to shoppers. However, organizations, companies, and individuals, for the purpose of making a greater profit or message, will take advantage of the online reviews system, leading to disinformation but perhaps most damagingly, a decrease in trust. One case of this occurring is illustrated during the release of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s memoir on Amazon.com. As was reported by many news sources, the memoir was the target of a “review bomb” where in one day, the book garnered a significant amount of one and five stars reviews. Because Amazon was struggling to incrementally parse through a significant number of these reviews – both from verified and unverified purchasers, the reviews section of her book became overrun with political dialogue, most of these not pertaining to the memoir that was supposed to be reviewed. Amazon was caught between a rock and a hard place, and to the frustration of many, removed overnight more than 900 reviews. The vendor, book publisher Simon and Shuster, and Amazon (both who have a financial interest in the success of their products listed on the all platform) articulated their perspective highlighting that it was seemingly unlikely that nearly 1,500 individuals read Secretary Clinton’s book overnight and came to an extremely positive or negative opinion of the book. This is an extreme example of how online reviews can be potentially manipulated, and calls into question the right level of policing regarding reviews and targets of review bombs. While this type of policing can be exercised, there will be some inherent bias introduced into the policing model whether it is performed by a team of humans or an automated process designed by humans. 1.3 Smarter Consumers &amp; Purchases through Data Science What is required is an application of data science visualization and data representation that is easily consumable by the average consumer that allows her to individually tease out any potential review bombs and bias and discount any of these less-than-genuine reviews. One easy win to combat review bombing and malicious activity is for websites to prohibit or severely discount (perhaps in the exclusion of aggregate ratings) reviews from non-verified purchases. For sites wishing to further combat review bombs, the display of a histogram of reviews over a period of time is a straightforward solution. Some marketplaces, such as Valve’s Steam, which has had a longstanding review bomb problem, have incorporated histograms to help provide transparency over the course of time. While it is difficult to inspire or encourage a large corporations to make a significant change in a core line of business where conversion rates of tenths of a percent can equate to millions of dollars, I am instead advocating for the development of a new website that would scrape eCommerce websites like Amazon, Ebay or Etsy and proactively filter out or de-prioritize unverified reviews, but also organize their reviews in a manner that allows users to more easily identify any possible review bombs (or even potential changes in product quality), through visual graphics like histograms. Going one step further, an enhanced product-search experience could be developed that could compare the specific reviews (and prices) of products from different websites and link back to the original website, monetizing based upon a revenue share agreement. Online review bombs, misinformation, and misunderstanding of reviews present a serious barrier for online shoppers to fully understand the quality of a product. While ecommerce firms are right to tread cautiously when changing the paradigm of online consumer shopping experiences, the potential ramifications of inaction can lead to deleterious effects for current and future customers, and shareholders. The creation of a proof-of-concept website that prioritizes validated customer reviews in a transparent display with integrated histograms would go a long way to solving these issues. "],

Competitors and investors examine corporate decisions and movements oftentimes with a close eye to understand the motivations of a company and whether a response is necessary. Indeed, these activities span the gamut from secret shopping, industry and sector research, to corporate espionage. Any nugget of information regarding a company’s strategy could yield millions or billions worth of increased forward-looking revenue. 2.2 Most Corporate Development Information is Secret – Except When You Need Outside Help In many industries, arms-races occur for the development of new products, service offerings, or expansion into new geographies and in many instances, the internal discussions and decisions involving these plans are highly sensitive. Outside stakeholders, whether they are investors, competitors, or partners who wish to capitalize off of a company’s new direction frequently cannot afford to not pay attention to the actions (or inaction) of a major player in their industry. With the rise of the Internet, job hunting and recruiting has migrated from the classifieds section in newspapers and bulletin boards, to job boards and careers sections in company websites. Frequently, for new initiatives in unfamiliar domains or geographies, companies must hire outside talent potentially yielding public visibility into what could be the outcome of very private, executive-level decision. Currently, there are no comprehensive platforms to go about scraping, cataloging, and analyzing the job postings and descriptions from companies online. This opportunity could significantly benefit other market players and investors, such as hedge funds seeking additional information to incorporate into their strategy or investment thesis. In other words, the data are there, but it is not being leveraged. 2.3 Working the un-worked data for Profit I am advocating for the development of a tool to help scrape, analyze, and classify new job postings on a company’s career webpage to gain further insight into a company’s direction and decision making. Currently the data is not being aggregated and synthesized into meaningful and actionable content – which could be useful to vendors, competitors, investors, and potential partners. For example, would we have been able to foretell the development of Google’s foray into becoming an ISP through their posting of job openings for ISP-related roles? Or perhaps could we also have identified the limited success and possible reorganization of the same initiative by identifying a reduction in hiring in certain geographies? Perhaps more prospectively, would we be able to predict if and when Amazon begins their push into the pharmaceutical market? The implications for online and mail order prescription services could be significant, doubly so for shareholders and investors. By leveraging data science to draw out these insights, we would be able to bring additional clarity into a previously less-clear area of competitive strategy. While the technical implementation will require additional thought, a rudimentary proof-of-concept system could be developed from scraping the careers pages from a handful of large corporations. The data could then be parsed for title, skills, and geographies and then assembled and cross-checked with an established ontological system. For public companies, an n-gram analysis could be conducted to identify senior management positions that do not have disclosure on their 10Ks or 10Qs, which could lead to a hypothesis of a new geography or product/service push. The implementation of such an application’s proof of concept could look like the following: Inputs: Shareholder letters, 10K, 10Q, other regulatory filings, company’s general webpage scrapings, webpage scrapes of corporate career pages. Development of Infrastructure: Creation of a skills and location ontology, so that specific skills roll-up appropriately to specific domains; likewise, specific localities roll up to their respective geographies. Creation of a warehouse of past job postings from corporate career pages. Based upon these ontologies and data warehouses, development of creation of n-gram index to compare a diff from new job postings and historical skills, positions, titles, products, and geographies. Output: Development of algorithm + dashboard + reporting + alerts system to identify major new hirings with respect to new skills, products, geographies, relative to historical data (See inputs). Example Process: Following setup and initial crunching, the web scraper constantly monitors Example.com to identify Example Corp’s new corporate listings for open positions. It identifies 27 new listings in the past three months for the hiring of technical staff familiar with a specific aerospace engineering protocol and design. The algorithm identifies this trend and looks in the past corpus of data to see whether these new hirings are in line with historical product lines or typical hiring. Identifying that this aerospace engineering protocol is brand new for this company, it flags the protocol and the specific job descriptions, identifying further n-gram commonalities and identifies additional commonalities such as location. The system then generates a report with this data including a top-level executive summary of this trend, implications for this technology based upon other company’s usage through syncing with other databases, and executes the dispatch of an alert to all subscribing clients who follow this company. My classmate I-Wae made a fantastic point that the context of the data could be further enriched if I can capture the possibility of developing an internal org chart through additional data like LinkedIn. This would be an excellent next step to further identify whether there is an opportunity to build out the organizational structure of a company and identify key decision makers and follow them very closely, for additional granular analysis. For example, if the individuals have public-facing social-media or news releases, the locations and content of these types of content could further enrich the core product of insights from job postings data. As the data is not fully being leveraged, there is a lot of blue ocean opportunity for a tool described to be built. However, in the long run, as the majority of information is publicly accessible, there would be the threat of other individuals being able to reverse-engineer or create a new system that could provide perhaps even detailed information. It is therefore important that this platform constantly be striving to provide more and more strategic and actionable information through improved insight generation and coverage across as many industries and geographies as possible.
