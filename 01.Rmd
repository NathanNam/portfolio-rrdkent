## The Environment

Online retail has fundamentally changed the way that consumers shop and purchase goods.  Popularized early on during the rise of e-commerce, was the implementation of elements of voice of the customer (VoC) that included product reviews and testimonials. These reviews became commonplace and quantified with the maturation of online shopping, but elements of abuse by both vendors, marketplaces, and customers are rife.

## The Issue at Hand

Consumers put a near blind faith in the validity and veracity of online reviews, doubly so from "reputable" marketplace sites such as AirBnB, eBay, and Amazon.  Product and service offerings are frequently displayed using algorithms that take into account the value of the aggregate mean customer review for a particular service or SKU.

Of particular concern is the gamesmanship of many parties in the marketplace, including the marketplace itself.  For instance, in the news recently was [a report](http://www.theblaze.com/news/2017/09/15/amazon-deleted-almost-all-of-the-negative-reviews-of-clintons-new-book-heres-why/) of a signficant change to Secretary Clinton's new memoir, which previously displayed a very very strong bimodal distribution, (the vast majority of reviews clustering at one and five).  However, overnight, the marketplace seller, Amazon removed 900+ reviews, the vast preponderance of those being negative.

Both the vendor, book publisher Simon and Shuster, and Amazon articulated their perspective of: "“It seems highly unlikely that approximately 1,500 people read Hillary Clinton’s book overnight and came to the stark conclusion that it is either brilliant or awful..." however, the vast majority of reviews removed were the negative reviews. - Prior to the removal, the book had nearly 1,700 reviews, with nearly 50% one-star, and 45% five star.  Following the re-adjustment, 95% of the "hundreds" of reviews that remained were very positive of the book.

Regardless of where one might stand politically, or the quality of Secretary Clinton's memoir, this situation seems to demonstrate a signficant issue with the reliance on online reviews and manipulation by the actors involved in the sale and purchase of the merchandise.
