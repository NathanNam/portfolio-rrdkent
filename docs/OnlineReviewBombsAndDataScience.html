<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> E-Commerce has altered how we shop and think about shopping</h2>
<p>Online retail has displaced a significant amount of brick-and-mortar retail and in doing so, fundamentally changed the way that consumers shop and purchase goods. If the rapid growth of Amazon and Walmart’s online offerings are any indication, retail e-commerce will continue to grow at a breakneck speed. For example, online retail sales are (expected)[ <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/272391/us-retail-e-commerce-sales-forecast/" class="uri">https://www.statista.com/statistics/272391/us-retail-e-commerce-sales-forecast/</a>] to nearly double between the period of 2016 and 2022.</p>
<p>As more and more individuals turned online to research and purchase goods, consumer behavior was altered by the inclusion of additional contextual information provided near product offerings that frequently increase products’ purchase rates. One such example, popularized early during the rise of e-commerce, was the inclusion of the voice of the customer in product reviews and testimonials. These reviews are now a standard e-commerce practice and can provide valuable insight into products’ quality for consumers, but manipulation from some actors can occlude the true quality of a product, leading to lost consumer surplus, confidence, increased returns, and dissatisfied customers.</p>
</div>
<div id="reviews-increased-conversion-but-buyer-beware" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Reviews: Increased Conversion, but Buyer Beware</h2>
<p>Many consumers place trust and confidence in online reviews – perhaps rightfully so as the theory of the “Wisdom of the Crowds” suggests. Online reviews provide an additional signal (in addition to price, brand, availability and so forth) about the quality of a good.</p>
<p>According to an <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-reviews-greatly-impact-online-shopping-sales-2017-3?&amp;platform=bi-androidapp">article</a> by Business Insider, a distinct portion of online shoppers will refuse to purchase products lacking positive reviews from other customers. Further, the article mentions, as we described above, that well-integrated, positive reviews have been demonstrated to increase sales by nearly 20% on some websites.</p>
<p>There is likely little doubt that the majority of individuals who write and consume online reviews do so with the best of intentions and were there no bad actors, online reviews would provide meaningful and valuable textual information to shoppers.</p>
<p>However, organizations, companies, and individuals, for the purpose of making a greater profit or message, will take advantage of the online reviews system, leading to disinformation but perhaps most damagingly, a decrease in trust.</p>
<p>One case of this occurring is illustrated during the release of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s memoir on Amazon.com. As was <a href="http://www.theblaze.com/news/2017/09/15/amazon-deleted-almost-all-of-the-negative-reviews-of-clintons-new-book-heres-why/">reported</a> by many news sources, the memoir was the target of a “review bomb” where in one day, the book garnered a significant amount of one and five stars reviews. Because Amazon was struggling to incrementally parse through a significant number of these reviews – both from verified and unverified purchasers, the reviews section of her book became overrun with political dialogue, most of these not pertaining to the memoir that was supposed to be reviewed.</p>
<p>Amazon was caught between a rock and a hard place, and to the frustration of many, removed overnight more than 900 reviews. The vendor, book publisher Simon and Shuster, and Amazon (both who have a financial interest in the success of their products listed on the all platform) articulated their perspective highlighting that it was seemingly unlikely that nearly 1,500 individuals read Secretary Clinton’s book overnight and came to an extremely positive or negative opinion of the book.</p>
<p>This is an extreme example of how online reviews can be potentially manipulated, and calls into question the right level of policing regarding reviews and targets of review bombs.</p>
<p>While this type of policing can be exercised, there will be some inherent bias introduced into the policing model whether it is performed by a team of humans or an automated process designed by humans.</p>
</div>
<div id="smarter-consumers-purchases-through-data-science" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> Smarter Consumers &amp; Purchases through Data Science</h2>
<p>What is required is an application of data science visualization and data representation that is easily consumable by the average consumer that allows her to individually tease out any potential review bombs and bias and discount any of these less-than-genuine reviews.</p>
<p>One easy win to combat review bombing and malicious activity is for websites to prohibit or severely discount (perhaps in the exclusion of aggregate ratings) reviews from non-verified purchases.</p>
<p>For sites wishing to further combat review bombs, the display of a histogram of reviews over a period of time is a straightforward solution. Some marketplaces, such as Valve’s Steam, which has had a longstanding review bomb problem, have <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/09/steam-has-a-review-bomb-problem-but-will-todays-new-feature-fix-it/?amp=1">incorporated</a> histograms to help provide transparency over the course of time.</p>
<p>While it is difficult to inspire or encourage a large corporations to make a significant change in a core line of business where conversion rates of tenths of a percent can equate to millions of dollars, I am instead advocating for the development of a new website that would scrape eCommerce websites like Amazon, Ebay or Etsy and proactively filter out or de-prioritize unverified reviews, but also organize their reviews in a manner that allows users to more easily identify any possible review bombs (or even potential changes in product quality), through visual graphics like histograms. Going one step further, an enhanced product-search experience could be developed that could compare the specific reviews (and prices) of products from different websites and link back to the original website, monetizing based upon a revenue share agreement.</p>
<p>Online review bombs, misinformation, and misunderstanding of reviews present a serious barrier for online shoppers to fully understand the quality of a product. While ecommerce firms are right to tread cautiously when changing the paradigm of online consumer shopping experiences, the potential ramifications of inaction can lead to deleterious effects for current and future customers, and shareholders. The creation of a proof-of-concept website that prioritizes validated customer reviews in a transparent display with integrated histograms would go a long way to solving these issues.</p>
