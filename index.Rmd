### Review Bombs Break Online Reviews and Data Science Transparency is the Answer

Online reviews play an incredibly important role in the online purchase path, but are subject to manipulation.  Alarmingly, through bad actors and organized groups, significant downside risks to the veracity of online reivews and trust in the marektplaces that host these reviews threaten potentially controversial ecommerce goods and services.  Data science is a solution that could better aggregate and inform customers, or potentially change the way online shoppers consume online reivews and choose products.  

### Could one companyâ€™s job postings lead to more revenue for a competitor?

For hedge funds, competitors, and everybody in between, nuggets of intel in aggregate can represent millions of dollars of forward-looking revenue advantage.  Product launches and expansions are typically reserved to closed-door board meetings, but much of this data must be made public for acquiring the most important resource in development and execution - labor.  Through the aggregation, data analysis, and development of actionable insights, data science has the potential to provide an opportunity to reduce information asymetries and better plan and counter activities through the analysis of jobs postings.
