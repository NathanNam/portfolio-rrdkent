## About the Webmaster

Biography
I am a Co-founder and COO/CPO at Jobwell.co and previously a Senior Manager at the LegalZoom.com Research and Development team and a Google Policy Fellow.  My MBA is from the Yale School of Management and I am working on a Masters in Information and Data Science at UC Berkeley. In 2003, I founded NetLiteracy.org, a technology-based 501(c)3 that has donated 42,000 computers and $14M in services. Our services were highlighted by the FCC in the National Broadband Plan presented to Congress, we received Computerworld's international 21st Century Award for creating "the most innovative application of IT to extend the distribution of digital information and access to Web-Based programs and services to previously underserved populations" and we have been honored by two American Presidents, including one in a private White House ceremony.
